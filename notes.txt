1. change password controller 
2. update delete course 
3. authorizing routes
4. validations
5.

______________________________________________________________________________

To-Do:
    1. (done)Fix update to be generic by using joi for validation.
    2. (done)Add hook for pre creation and update 
    3. get all users and courses (can be merged with getOne??)
    4. search for users and courses (No use cases in mind where we would need to search with smth other than id which is solved by getOne)
    5. Complete verification after fixing update user 
    6. fix update course to be like update user 
    7. think about onDelete and onUpdate, should we make them cascade or set null, should we handle them manually?
    8. test deleteUser and add it to postman
    9. google sign in

1. How about getting rid of id in user model, and depending on username as the primary key?   --id is for retrieving the objs , username is autogenerated and for users
2. If we get rid of username instead and keep the id, we shouldn't auto increment but use an id generation function.  --ana 3mlt kda bosy 3aleeha
3. If we take into account social media login, many fields which were marked not null will be changed to can be null. However we will need to add a "complete your profile" feature.   -- aywa mmkn ne3adelha lama n-add sa3etha
4. How are we going to handle errors? I used an error handler before at the end of my code so whenever there was an error i would call next(error);  -- msh fahmek ,khaleena lama nedkhol netkalem
5. check user controller (getOne), is the code duplicated? i commented what caused a "Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client" error?  -- fixed sth there
6. we can use express.json() and express.urlencoded() without the need for bodyparser  -- kan fy haga msh btshtaghal m3 express.json() fkreeny a2olk lama nedkhol brdo
7. need an "app password" of an official USAM gmail, to be able to send emails.
